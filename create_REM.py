"""
Scripts to create a Relative Elevation Model (REM) using only a DEM as an input.
Steps:

1. Get streams from whitebox tools. These are thresholded to a flow accumulation (e.g. basin areas in projected units).
    A "thinned" stream is also produced where the number of nodes is reduced
2. Create transects from the thinned streams. These transects are perpendicular to the stream and spaced at a specified interval.
3. Get elevation values along the transects from the DEM. The options are to pick the minimum value along the transect (e.g. water surface) or the median value (e.g. valley bottom)
   The width of these transects should be set to the approximate width of the valley bottom.
   Points are created along each transect line at the minimum value as well as both ends of the transect.
4. Interpolate the elevation values to create a continuous surface.
